# Project Description / Outline

Compare two different models (univariate [Prophet] vs. multivariate [Keras/Sequentia]) to
determine which provides more accurate predictions regarding Bitcoin price.

# Research Questions to Answer

1. Regarding multivariate models, which indicators will best predict Bitcoin's price?
1. How do the two models compare to one another?

# Datasets to be Used

1. Google Trends (PyTrends)
1. Alpaca (BTC)
1. Fear and Greed Index
