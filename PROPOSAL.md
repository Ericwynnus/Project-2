# Project Description / Outline

Predict Bitcoin price based on Indicators (Google Trends, etc.)

# Research Questions to Answer

1. How do we discover our options for models and scalers (libraries, services, etc.)
1. Which indicators will best predict Bitcoin's price?
1. Which model and scaler works best for a given set of indicators?

# Datasets to be Used

1. Google Trends
1. Alpaca (BTC)
1. Reuters
1. Fear and Greed Index

# Task Breakdown (Due Dates; End of Class)

## Apr 2, 2022

1. High level project decisions
1. Environment configuration
1. Project scaffolding

### Homework:

1. Investigate alternative libraries to scikit and tensorflow
1. Investigate alternative models within scikit and tensorflow

## Apr 4, 2022

1. Collect indicator data
1. Decide on a second model/service to use as an alternative predictor
   1. "Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class."
1. Create models for 3 indicators, choosing 2 different libraries/service for training & predictions
